## Project Details

### Objective:
To analyze the distribution of investment durations and the impact of monitoring frequencies on investor preferences.

### Steps Performed:
1. **Investment Duration Analysis:**
   - Visualized the distribution of investment durations to identify popular timeframes across investment avenues.

2. **Monitoring Frequency Analysis:**
   - Examined how often investments are monitored (daily, weekly, monthly) and their correlation with specific investment avenues.

### Key Insights:
- **Medium-term Investments Are Preferred**:  
  Most investments fall within the **1-3 years** and **3-5 years** durations, showing a balance between risk and growth potential.

- **Monitoring Frequency Patterns**:  
  - **Daily Monitoring:** Commonly associated with equities, reflecting active engagement.  
  - **Monthly Monitoring:** Dominates for fixed deposits and mutual funds, indicating systematic tracking.  

- **Behavioral Trends**:  
  - **Younger Investors:** Prefer short-term investments with frequent monitoring.  
  - **Older Investors:** Favor long-term investments with less frequent engagement.  

- **Stability vs. Engagement**:  
  Frequent monitoring is linked to riskier assets, while long-term investments prioritize stability and lower involvement.
